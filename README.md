# Project Description

With the rising inflation, I want to know how much we pay for commodties at a given time. Therefore, I leveraged a Kaggle dataset called [Commodity Prices Dataset (2000 - 2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashish311601/commodity-prices) in this project. A wed app was delivered using the Dask data framework and Fast API. The app will take inputs from users and return the price of a commodity for a specific date. For example, one can put in "2000-01-18" and "GOLD" to review the gold price on the given date.
