In this project, I used a Kaggle dataset called Commodity Prices Dataset (2000 - 2022): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashish311601/commodity-prices. The csv file includes the prices for 23 different commodities from 2000 until present. I read into the dataset using dask, and built a function to return the price of a commodity based on the commodity type and the date.
